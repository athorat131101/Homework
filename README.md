This repository contains my submission for Homework 1 of the STAT40830 â€“ Advanced Data Programming with R module at UCD. The assignment focuses on exploring the built-in R dataset ToothGrowth, which examines the impact of vitamin C dosage and supplement type (orange juice vs. ascorbic acid) on tooth growth in guinea pigs.

The project includes:
- A summary of the dataset
- A grouped bar plot visualizing mean tooth lengths
- Interpretations based on supplement type and dosage
All analysis is done using ggplot2 and dplyr in R Markdown and rendered to PDF.
